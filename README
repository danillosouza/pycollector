                           Collecting data should be simple.

--------
| Goal |
--------

Moving data from A to B is a well known task in computing.
Our aim here is to make it easier to 'develop' and 'configure' a piece of 
software to collect data.


----------------
| How it works |
----------------

There are two main components of any collecting process:

- Readers
  Piece of code that takes the responsability of going to the source of the
  data and prepare it to be written somewhere else.

- Writers
  Piece of code that takes a read message and delivers to the destiny.

Readers and writers may make any transformation to the original data.

 1. ask source________                         _________   5. write destiny
    <-------|        |                         |        |------------------>
            | Reader |                         | Writer |
    ------->|________|                    +--->|________|
   2. answer    |                         |
                |            __________   | 4. get stored msgs
                +----------> | internal|--+
                 3.store     |  queue  |
                             |_________|

Improving core;
Increasing test coverage.
