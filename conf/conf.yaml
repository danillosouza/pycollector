# File: conf.yaml
# Description: This file is read by pycollector to
#              configure readers/writers.
#              This file is supposed to be divided
#              in two sections: specs, conf
#
# specs: map names to specific configurations
#        Everything defined inside a spec is replaced where
#        it is being used (see conf section).
#
# conf:  List of pairs (reader, writer)
#        Since it is natural to have same specifications for readers/writers
#        it is encouraged to use specs.
#
#        A reader/writer must have a type.
#        A reader/writer may present an interval (in seconds) property.
#        If a writer has a key 'async' it will be called whenever a
#        message is read.
